Providing a mechanism for concluding the operations of the interstate commission and the return of surplus funds that may exist upon the termination of the compact after the payment and reserving of all of its debts and obligations; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">7. Providing "start-up" rules for initial administration of the compact.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">B. The interstate commission shall, by a majority of the members, elect annually from among its members a chairperson, a vice chairperson, and a treasurer, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson or, in the chairperson's absence or disability, the vice chairperson, shall preside at all meetings of the interstate commission. The officers so elected shall serve without compensation or remuneration from the interstate commission; provided that, subject to the availability of budgeted funds, the officers shall be reimbursed for ordinary and necessary costs and expenses incurred by them in the performance of their responsibilities as officers of the interstate commission.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">C. Executive committee, officers, and personnel</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">1. The executive committee shall have such authority and duties as may be set forth in the bylaws, including but not limited to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">a. Managing the affairs of the interstate commission in a manner consistent with the bylaws and purposes of the interstate commission;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">b. Overseeing an organizational structure within, and appropriate procedures for the interstate commission to provide for the creation of rules, operating procedures, and administrative and technical support functions; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">c. Planning, implementing, and coordinating communications and activities with other state, federal, and local government organizations in order to advance the goals of the interstate commission.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">2. The executive committee may, subject to the approval of the interstate commission, appoint or retain an executive director for such period, upon such terms and conditions and for such compensation, as the interstate commission may deem appropriate. The executive director shall serve as secretary to the interstate commission, but shall not be a member of the interstate commission. The executive director shall hire and supervise such other persons as may be authorized by the interstate commission.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">D. The interstate commission's executive director and its employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">1. The liability of the interstate commission's executive director and employees or interstate commission representatives, acting within the scope of such person's employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions occurring within such person's state may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the Constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents. The interstate commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">2. The interstate commission shall defend the executive director and its employees and, subject to the approval of the attorney general or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by an interstate commission representative, shall defend such interstate commission representative in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">3. To the extent not covered by the state involved, member state, or the interstate commission, the representatives or employees of the interstate commission shall be held harmless in the amount of a settlement or judgment, including attorneys' fees and costs, obtained against such persons arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons.</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;">ARTICLE XII</div><div style="text-align:center;">RULE-MAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">A. Rule-making authority - The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the interstate commission exercises its rule-making authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">B. Rule-making procedure - Rules shall be made pursuant to a rule-making process that substantially conforms to the "model state administrative procedure act," of 1981, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000) as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the interstate commission.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">C. Not later than thirty days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the interstate commission's authority.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">D. If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;">ARTICLE XIII</div><div style="text-align:center;">OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">A. Oversight</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the interstate commission.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">3. The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the interstate commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">B. Default, technical assistance, suspension, and termination - If the interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">1. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">2. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">3. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">4. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">5. The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination including obligations the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">6. The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">7. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">C. Dispute Resolution</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">1. The interstate commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">2. The interstate commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">D. Enforcement</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">1. The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">2. The interstate commission, may by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United State[s] District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, and its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;">ARTICLE XIV</div><div style="text-align:center;">FINANCING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">A. The interstate commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">B. The interstate commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the interstate commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the interstate commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">C. The interstate commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the interstate commission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and with the authority of the member state.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">D. The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the interstate commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the interstate commission.</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;">ARTICLE XV</div><div style="text-align:center;">MEMBER STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE, AND AMENDMENT</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">A. Any state is eligible to become a member state.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">B. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than ten of the states. The effective date shall be no earlier than December 1, 2007.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Thereafter it shall become effective and binding as to any other member state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the activities of the interstate commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">C. The interstate commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the member states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the member states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the member states.</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;">ARTICLE XVI</div><div style="text-align:center;">WITHDRAWAL AND DISSOLUTION</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">A. Withdrawal</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">1. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every member state; provided that a member state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute, which enacted the compact into law.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">2. Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until one year after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other member jurisdiction.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">3. The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">4. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">5. Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">B. Dissolution of compact</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">1. This compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the member state which reduces the membership in the compact to one member state.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">2. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be concluded and surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;">ARTICLE XVII</div><div style="text-align:center;">SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">A. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">B. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">C. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prohibit the applicability of other interstate compacts to which the states are members.</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;">ARTICLE XVIII</div><div style="text-align:center;">BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">A. Other laws</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">1. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with this compact.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">2. All member states' laws conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">B. Binding effect of the compact</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">1. All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon the member states.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">2. All agreements between the interstate commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">3. In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any member state, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that member state.</div></div><div style="margin-top:15pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">[ <a href='http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session Laws/Senate/5248-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009 c 380 § 1'>2009 c 380 § 1</a>.]</div></div>
