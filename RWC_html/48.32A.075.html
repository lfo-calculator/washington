However, the association may not exercise an election with respect to a reinsurance agreement if the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator of the member insurer has previously and expressly disaffirmed the reinsurance agreement. The election is effective when notice is provided to the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator and to the affected reinsurers. If the association makes an election, the following provisions apply with respect to the agreements selected by the association:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The association is responsible for all unpaid premiums due under the agreements, for periods both before and after the coverage date, and is responsible for the performance of all other obligations to be performed after the coverage date, in each case which relate to contracts covered, in whole or in part, by the association. The association may charge contracts covered in part by the association, through reasonable allocation methods, the costs for reinsurance in excess of the obligations of the association;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The association is entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the agreements with respect to losses or events that occur in periods after the coverage date and that relate to contracts covered by the association, in whole or in part. However, upon receipt of any such amounts, the association is obliged to pay to the beneficiary under the policy or contract on account of which the amounts were paid a portion of the amount equal to the excess of: The amount received by the association, over the benefits paid by the association on account of the policy or contract, less the retention of the impaired or insolvent member insurer applicable to the loss or event;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Within thirty days following the association's election, the association and each indemnity reinsurer shall calculate the net balance due to or from the association under each reinsurance agreement as of the date of the association's election, giving full credit to all items paid by either the member insurer, or its receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator, or the indemnity reinsurer during the period between the coverage date and the date of the association's election. Either the association or indemnity reinsurer shall pay the net balance due the other within five days of the completion of this calculation. If the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator has received any amounts due the association pursuant to (a)(ii) of this subsection, the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator shall remit the same to the association as promptly as practicable; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) If the association, within sixty days of the election, pays the premiums due for periods both before and after the coverage date that relate to contracts covered by the association, in whole or in part, the reinsurer is not entitled to terminate the reinsurance agreements, insofar as the agreements relate to contracts covered by the association, in whole or in part, and is not entitled to set off any unpaid premium due for periods prior to the coverage date against amounts due the association;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) In the event the association transfers its obligations to another insurer, and if the association and the other insurer agree, the other insurer succeeds to the rights and obligations of the association under (a) of this subsection effective as of the date agreed upon by the association and the other insurer and regardless of whether the association has made the election referred to in (a) of this subsection. However:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The indemnity reinsurance agreements automatically terminate for new reinsurance unless the indemnity reinsurer and the other insurer agree to the contrary;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The obligations described in (a)(ii) of this subsection no longer apply on and after the date the indemnity reinsurance agreement is transferred to the third party insurer; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) This subsection (14)(b) does not apply if the association has previously expressly determined in writing that it will not exercise the election referred to in (a) of this subsection;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The provisions of this subsection supersede the provisions of any law of this state or of any affected reinsurance agreement that provides for or requires any payment of reinsurance proceeds, on account of losses or events that occur in periods after the coverage date, to the receiver, liquidator, or rehabilitator of the insolvent member insurer. The receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator remains entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance agreement with respect to losses or events that occur in periods prior to the coverage date, subject to applicable setoff provisions; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Except as set forth under this subsection, this subsection does not alter or modify the terms and conditions of the indemnity reinsurance agreements of the insolvent member insurer. This subsection does not abrogate or limit any rights of any reinsurer to claim that it is entitled to rescind a reinsurance agreement. This subsection does not give a policy owner or beneficiary an independent cause of action against an indemnity reinsurer that is not otherwise set forth in the indemnity reinsurance agreement.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(15) The board of directors of the association has discretion and may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the association provides the benefits of this chapter in an economical and efficient manner.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(16) When the association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits of this chapter to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association's obligations under this chapter, the person is not entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(17) Venue in a suit against the association arising under this chapter is in the county in which liquidation or rehabilitation proceedings have been filed in the case of a domestic insurer. In other cases, venue is in King county or Thurston county. The association is not required to give an appeal bond in an appeal that relates to a cause of action arising under this chapter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(18) In carrying out its duties in connection with guaranteeing, assuming, or reinsuring policies or contracts under subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the association may, subject to approval of the receivership court, issue substitute coverage for a policy or contract that provides an interest rate, crediting rate, or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value by issuing an alternative policy or contract in accordance with the following provisions:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) In lieu of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contract provides for: (i) A fixed interest rate; (ii) payment of dividends with minimum guarantees; or (iii) a different method for calculating interest or changes in value;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) There is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period, or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The alternative policy or contract is substantially similar to the replaced policy or contract in all other material terms.</div></div><div style="margin-top:15pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">[ <a href='http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session Laws/Senate/5958-S.SL.pdf?cite=2001 c 50 § 8'>2001 c 50 § 8</a>.]</div></div>
