The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the crime control act, 4 U.S.C. Sec. 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: To provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) In addition, this compact will: Create an interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections, or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) The compacting states recognize that there is no "right" of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;">ARTICLE II</div><div style="text-align:center;">DEFINITIONS</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) "Adult" means both individuals legally classified as adults and juveniles treated as adults by court order, statute, or operation of law.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) "Bylaws" means those bylaws established by the interstate commission for its governance, or for directing or controlling the interstate commission's actions or conduct.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) "Compact administrator" means the individual in each compacting state appointed pursuant to the terms of this compact responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of offenders subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the interstate commission and policies adopted by the state council under this compact.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) "Compacting state" means any state which has enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) "Commissioner" means the voting representative of each compacting state appointed pursuant to article III of this compact.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) "Interstate commission" means the interstate commission for adult offender supervision established by this compact.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) "Member" means the commissioner of a compacting state or designee, who shall be a person officially connected with the commissioner.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) "Noncompacting state" means any state which has not enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) "Offender" means an adult placed under, or subject, to supervision as the result of the commission of a criminal offense and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections, or other criminal justice agencies.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(j) "Person" means any individual, corporation, business enterprise, or other legal entity, either public or private.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(k) "Rules" means acts of the interstate commission, duly promulgated pursuant to article VIII of this compact, substantially affecting interested parties in addition to the interstate commission, which shall have the force and effect of law in the compacting states.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(l) "State" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia and any other territorial possessions of the United States.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(m) "State council" means the resident members of the state council for interstate adult offender supervision created by each state under article IV of this compact.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(n) "Victim" means a person who has sustained emotional, psychological, physical, or financial injury to person or property as a result of criminal conduct against the person or a member of the person's family.</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;">ARTICLE III</div><div style="text-align:center;">THE COMPACT COMMISSION</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The compacting states hereby create the "interstate commission for adult offender supervision."

No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;">ARTICLE XII</div><div style="text-align:center;">WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION, AND</div><div style="text-align:center;">JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">(a) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Withdrawal.</span> (1) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state: PROVIDED, That a compacting state may withdraw from the compact ("withdrawing state") by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Default.</span> (1) If the interstate commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted ("defaulting state") in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws or any duly promulgated rules, the interstate commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the interstate commission;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the interstate commission;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Suspension and termination of membership in the compact.

The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The interstate commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the interstate commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the interstate commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer and the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the state council of such termination.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.
