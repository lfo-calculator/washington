The legislature further finds that: Sixty-five percent of all suicides, and most suicide deaths and attempts for young people ages ten to eighteen, occur using firearms and prescription medications that are easily accessible in homes; firearms are the most lethal method used in suicide and almost entirely account for more men dying by suicide than women; sixty-seven percent of all veteran deaths by suicide are by firearm; and nearly eighty percent of all deaths by firearms in Washington are suicides. The legislature further finds that there is a need for a robust public education campaign designed to raise awareness of suicide and to teach everyone the role that he or she can play in suicide prevention. The legislature further finds that important suicide prevention efforts include: Motivating households to improve safe storage practices to reduce deaths from firearms and prescription medications; decreasing barriers to prevent access to lethal means by allowing for temporary and voluntary transfers of firearms when individuals are at risk for suicide; increasing access to drug take-back sites; and making the public aware of suicide prevention steps, including recognizing warning signs, empathizing and listening, asking directly about suicide, removing dangers to ensure immediate safety, and getting help. The legislature intends by this act to create a public-private partnership fund to implement a suicide-safer home public education campaign in the coming years."

The legislature further finds that when suicide occurs, it has devastating consequences for communities and schools, yet, according to the United States surgeon general, suicide is the nation's most preventable form of death. The legislature further finds that one of the most immediate ways to reduce the tragedy of suicide is through suicide awareness and prevention education coupled with safe storage of lethal means commonly used in suicides, such as firearms and prescription medications. The legislature further finds that encouraging firearms dealers to voluntarily participate in suicide awareness and prevention education programs and provide certain safe storage devices at cost is an important step in creating safer homes and reducing suicide deaths in the state."

The legislature further finds that: Sixty-five percent of all suicides, and most suicide deaths and attempts for young people ages ten to eighteen, occur using firearms and prescription medications that are easily accessible in homes; firearms are the most lethal method used in suicide and almost entirely account for more men dying by suicide than women; sixty-seven percent of all veteran deaths by suicide are by firearm; and nearly eighty percent of all deaths by firearms in Washington are suicides. The legislature further finds that there is a need for a robust public education campaign designed to raise awareness of suicide and to teach everyone the role that he or she can play in suicide prevention. The legislature further finds that important suicide prevention efforts include: Motivating households to improve safe storage practices to reduce deaths from firearms and prescription medications; decreasing barriers to prevent access to lethal means by allowing for temporary and voluntary transfers of firearms when individuals are at risk for suicide; increasing access to drug take-back sites; and making the public aware of suicide prevention steps, including recognizing warning signs, empathizing and listening, asking directly about suicide, removing dangers to ensure immediate safety, and getting help. The legislature intends by this act to create a public-private partnership fund to implement a suicide-safer home public education campaign in the coming years."

The legislature further finds that when suicide occurs, it has devastating consequences for communities and schools, yet, according to the United States surgeon general, suicide is the nation's most preventable form of death. The legislature further finds that one of the most immediate ways to reduce the tragedy of suicide is through suicide awareness and prevention education coupled with safe storage of lethal means commonly used in suicides, such as firearms and prescription medications. The legislature further finds that encouraging firearms dealers to voluntarily participate in suicide awareness and prevention education programs and provide certain safe storage devices at cost is an important step in creating safer homes and reducing suicide deaths in the state."
