If the area code is not assigned to landlines in any specific geographic area, such as with toll-free telephone numbers, a call to a telephone is presumed to be received in the local time zone of the debtor's last known place of residence, unless the licensee reasonably believes the telephone is located in a different time zone.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(14) Communicate with the debtor through use of forms or instruments that simulate the form or appearance of judicial process, the form or appearance of government documents, or the simulation of a form or appearance of a telegraphic or emergency message.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(15) Communicate with the debtor and represent or imply that the existing obligation of the debtor may be or has been increased by the addition of attorney fees, investigation fees, service fees, or any other fees or charges when in fact such fees or charges may not legally be added to the existing obligation of such debtor.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(16) Threaten to take any action against the debtor which the licensee cannot legally take at the time the threat is made.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(17) Send any telegram or make any telephone calls to a debtor or concerning a debt or for the purpose of demanding payment of a claim or seeking information about a debtor, for which the charges are payable by the addressee or by the person to whom the call is made: PROVIDED, That:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) This subsection does not prohibit a licensee from attempting to communicate by way of a cellular telephone or other wireless device: PROVIDED, That a licensee cannot cause charges to be incurred to the recipient of the attempted communication more than three times in any calendar week when the licensee knows or reasonably should know that the number belongs to a cellular telephone or other wireless device, unless the licensee is responding to a communication from the debtor or the person to whom the call is made.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The licensee is not in violation of (a) of this subsection if the licensee at least monthly updates its records with information provided by a commercial provider of cellular telephone lists that the licensee in good faith believes provides reasonably current and comprehensive data identifying cellular telephone numbers, calls a number not appearing in the most recent list provided by the commercial provider, and does not otherwise know or reasonably should know that the number belongs to a cellular telephone.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) This subsection may not be construed to increase the number of communications permitted pursuant to subsection (13)(a) of this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(18) Call, or send a text message or other electronic communication to, a cellular telephone or other wireless device more than twice in any day when the licensee knows or reasonably should know that the number belongs to a cellular telephone or other wireless device, unless the licensee is responding to a communication from the debtor or the person to whom the call, text message, or other electronic communication is made.

and (e) the debtor advised the licensee that the subject debt is disputed because the identified check, automated clearinghouse transaction on a demand deposit account, or other preprinted written instrument underlying the debt is a stolen or fraudulently created check or instrument.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The licensee is not in violation of this subsection if the licensee initiates oral contact with the debtor more than one time in an attempt to collect debts arising from the identified series of dishonored checks, automated clearinghouse transactions on a demand deposit account, or other preprinted written instruments when: (i) The licensee acted in good faith and relied on their established practices and procedures for batching, recording, or packeting debtor accounts, and the licensee inadvertently initiates oral contact with the debtor in an attempt to collect debts in the identified series subsequent to the initial debt assigned to the licensee; (ii) the licensee is following up on collection of a debt assigned to the licensee, and the debtor has previously requested more information from the licensee regarding the subject debt; (iii) the debtor has notified the licensee that the debtor disputes only some, but not all the debts arising from the identified series of dishonored checks, automated clearinghouse transactions on a demand deposit account, or other preprinted written instruments, in which case the licensee shall be allowed to initiate oral contact with the debtor one time for each debt arising from the series of identified checks, automated clearinghouse transactions on a demand deposit account, or written instruments and initiate additional oral contact for those debts that the debtor acknowledges do not arise from stolen or fraudulently created checks or written instruments; (iv) the oral contact is in the context of a judicial, administrative, arbitration, mediation, or similar proceeding; or (v) the oral contact is made for the purpose of investigating, confirming, or authenticating the information received from the debtor, to provide additional information to the debtor, or to request additional information from the debtor needed by the licensee to accurately record the debtor's information in the licensee's records.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(25) Bring an action or initiate an arbitration proceeding on a claim for any amounts related to a transfer of sale of a vehicle when:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The licensee has been informed or reasonably should know that the department of licensing transfer of sale form was filed in accordance with RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.12.650'>46.12.650</a> (1) through (3);</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The licensee has been informed or reasonably should know that the transfer of the vehicle either (i) was not made pursuant to a legal transfer or (ii) was not voluntarily accepted by the person designated as the purchaser/transferee;

This superior court practice, known as "pocket service," is not allowed in Washington's courts of limited jurisdiction, including the district courts. Pocket service need not interfere with a defendant's due process rights if the defendant is represented by counsel or otherwise familiar with local legal procedural rules;</div><div style="text-indent:0.75in;">(c) In the debt collection context, however, many defendants are unfamiliar with the legal process, and most are unrepresented. When served with an unfiled, unnumbered summons and complaint, these defendants do not always realize that they must respond to the unfiled case, or know how to do so, to avoid a default judgment;</div><div style="text-indent:0.75in;">(d) In the debt collection context, many unrepresented defendants reasonably conclude that the unnumbered summons and complaint are not valid, particularly when they call the court and are told that no case has been filed. They then intentionally fail to answer and unwittingly give up their only opportunity to contest the debt;</div><div style="text-indent:0.75in;">(e) For these reasons, among others, a majority of defendants in debt collection cases filed in Washington superior courts fail to respond to the summons and complaint and, as a result, have default judgments entered against them.</div><div style="text-indent:0.75in;">(2) Therefore, the legislature intends to require that debt collection complaints be filed prior to service of the summons and complaint on defendants to ensure that defendants understand that it is an existing court case, are informed of the case number, and receive adequate notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond and be heard to avoid default judgment."
