The statement must be furnished within fifteen days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the board, and every unit owner unless, and to the extent, known by the recipient to be false. The liability of a recipient who reasonably relies upon the statement must not exceed the amount set forth in any statement furnished pursuant to this section or RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=64.90.640'>64.90.640</a>(1)(b).</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(12) In a cooperative, upon nonpayment of an assessment on a unit, the unit owner may be evicted in the same manner as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a commercial tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed as provided under this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(13) The association's lien may be foreclosed in accordance with (a) and (b) of this subsection.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) In a common interest community other than a cooperative, the association's lien may be foreclosed judicially in accordance with chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=61.12'>61.12</a> RCW, subject to any rights of redemption under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=6.23'>6.23</a> RCW.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The lien may be enforced nonjudicially in the manner set forth in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=61.24'>61.24</a> RCW for nonjudicial foreclosure of deeds of trust if the declaration: Contains a grant of the common interest community in trust to a trustee qualified under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=61.24.010'>61.24.010</a> to secure the obligations of the unit owners to the association for the payment of assessments, contains a power of sale, provides in its terms that the units are not used principally for agricultural purposes, and provides that the power of sale is operative in the case of a default in the obligation to pay assessments. The association or its authorized representative may purchase the unit at the foreclosure sale and acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the unit. Upon an express waiver in the complaint of any right to a deficiency judgment in a judicial foreclosure action, the period of redemption is eight months.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) In a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests in the units are real estate, the association's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real estate or by power of sale under (b) of this subsection.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) In a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests in the units are personal property, the association's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a security interest under chapter 62A.9A RCW.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(14) If the unit owner's interest in a unit in a cooperative is real estate, the following requirements apply:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The association, upon nonpayment of assessments and compliance with this subsection, may sell that unit at a public sale or by private negotiation, and at any time and place. The association must give to the unit owner and any lessee of the unit owner reasonable notice in a record of the time, date, and place of any public sale or, if a private sale is intended, of the intention of entering into a contract to sell and of the time and date after which a private conveyance may be made. Such notice must also be sent to any other person that has a recorded interest in the unit that would be cut off by the sale, but only if the recorded interest was on record seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date of any public sale or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may be made. The notices required under this subsection may be sent to any address reasonable in the circumstances. A sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice. The association may buy at any public sale and, if the sale is conducted by a fiduciary or other person not related to the association, at a private sale.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Unless otherwise agreed to or as stated in this section, the unit owner is liable for any deficiency in a foreclosure sale.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The proceeds of a foreclosure sale must be applied in the following order:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The reasonable expenses of sale;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The reasonable expenses of securing possession before sale; the reasonable expenses of holding, maintaining, and preparing the unit for sale, including payment of taxes and other governmental charges and premiums on insurance; and, to the extent provided for by agreement between the association and the unit owner, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and other legal expenses incurred by the association;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Satisfaction of the association's lien;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) Satisfaction in the order of priority of any subordinate claim of record; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(v) Remittance of any excess to the unit owner.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) A good-faith purchaser for value acquires the unit free of the association's debt that gave rise to the lien under which the foreclosure sale occurred and any subordinate interest, even though the association or other person conducting the sale failed to comply with this section. The person conducting the sale must execute a conveyance to the purchaser sufficient to convey the unit and stating that it is executed by the person after a foreclosure of the association's lien by power of sale and that the person was empowered to make the sale. Signature and title or authority of the person signing the conveyance as grantor and a recital of the facts of nonpayment of the assessment and of the giving of the notices required under this subsection are sufficient proof of the facts recited and of the authority to sign. Further proof of authority is not required even though the association is named as grantee in the conveyance.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) At any time before the association has conveyed a unit in a cooperative or entered into a contract for its conveyance under the power of sale, the unit owners or the holder of any subordinate security interest may cure the unit owner's default and prevent sale or other conveyance by tendering the performance due under the security agreement, including any amounts due because of exercise of a right to accelerate, plus the reasonable expenses of proceeding to foreclosure incurred to the time of tender, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the creditor.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(15) In an action by an association to collect assessments or to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section, the court may appoint a receiver to collect all sums alleged to be due and owing to a unit owner before commencement or during pendency of the action. The receivership is governed under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.60'>7.60</a> RCW. During pendency of the action, the court may order the receiver to pay sums held by the receiver to the association for any assessments against the unit. The exercise of rights under this subsection by the association does not affect the priority of preexisting liens on the unit.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(16) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the holder of a mortgage or other purchaser of a unit who obtains the right of possession of the unit through foreclosure is not liable for assessments or installments of assessments that became due prior to such right of possession. Such unpaid assessments are deemed to be common expenses collectible from all the unit owners, including such mortgagee or other purchaser of the unit. Foreclosure of a mortgage does not relieve the prior unit owner of personal liability for assessments accruing against the unit prior to the date of such sale as provided in this subsection.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(17) In addition to constituting a lien on the unit, each assessment is the joint and several obligation of the unit owner of the unit to which the same are assessed as of the time the assessment is due. A unit owner may not exempt himself or herself from liability for assessments. In a voluntary conveyance other than by foreclosure, the grantee of a unit is jointly and severally liable with the grantor for all unpaid assessments against the grantor up to the time of the grantor's conveyance, without prejudice to the grantee's right to recover from the grantor the amounts paid by the grantee. Suit to recover a personal judgment for any delinquent assessment is maintainable in any court of competent jurisdiction without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing such sums.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(18) The association may from time to time establish reasonable late charges and a rate of interest to be charged, not to exceed the maximum rate calculated under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.52.020'>19.52.020</a>, on all subsequent delinquent assessments or installments of assessments. If the association does not establish such a rate, delinquent assessments bear interest from the date of delinquency at the maximum rate calculated under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.52.020'>19.52.020</a> on the date on which the assessments became delinquent.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(19) The association is entitled to recover any costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the collection of delinquent assessments, whether or not such collection activities result in a suit being commenced or prosecuted to judgment. The prevailing party is also entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in such suits, including any appeals, if it prevails on appeal and in the enforcement of a judgment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(20) To the extent not inconsistent with this section, the declaration may provide for such additional remedies for collection of assessments as may be permitted by law.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(21) An association may not commence an action to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section unless:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The unit owner, at the time the action is commenced, owes at least a sum equal to the greater of:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Three months or more of assessments, not including fines, late charges, interest, attorneys' fees, or costs incurred by the association in connection with the collection of a delinquent owner's account; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) $200 of assessments, not including fines, late charges, interest, attorneys' fees, or costs incurred by the association in connection with the collection of a delinquent owner's account;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) At or after the date that assessments have become past due for at least 90 days, the association has mailed, by first-class mail, to the owner, at the unit address and to any other address which the owner has provided to the association, a notice of delinquency, which shall state as follows:</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">THIS IS A NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY FOR PAST DUE ASSESSMENTS</span></div><div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">FROM THE UNIT OWNERS' ASSOCIATION TO WHICH YOUR HOME BELONGS.</span></div><div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">THIS NOTICE IS ONE STEP IN A PROCESS THAT COULD RESULT IN YOUR LOSING YOUR HOME</span>.</div><div style="text-indent:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">CONTACT A HOUSING COUNSELOR OR AN ATTORNEY LICENSED IN WASHINGTON NOW</span> to assess your situation and refer you to mediation if you might benefit. <span style="font-weight:bold;">DO NOT DELAY</span>.</div><div style="text-indent:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">BE CAREFUL</span> of people who claim they can help you.

The statement must be furnished within fifteen days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the board, and every unit owner unless, and to the extent, known by the recipient to be false.

The association or its authorized representative may purchase the unit at the foreclosure sale and acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the unit. Upon an express waiver in the complaint of any right to a deficiency judgment in a judicial foreclosure action, the period of redemption is eight months.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) In a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests in the units are real estate, the association's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real estate or by power of sale under (b) of this subsection.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) In a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests in the units are personal property, the association's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a security interest under chapter 62A.9A RCW.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(14) If the unit owner's interest in a unit in a cooperative is real estate, the following requirements apply:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The association, upon nonpayment of assessments and compliance with this subsection, may sell that unit at a public sale or by private negotiation, and at any time and place. The association must give to the unit owner and any lessee of the unit owner reasonable notice in a record of the time, date, and place of any public sale or, if a private sale is intended, of the intention of entering into a contract to sell and of the time and date after which a private conveyance may be made. Such notice must also be sent to any other person that has a recorded interest in the unit that would be cut off by the sale, but only if the recorded interest was on record seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date of any public sale or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may be made. The notices required under this subsection may be sent to any address reasonable in the circumstances. A sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice. The association may buy at any public sale and, if the sale is conducted by a fiduciary or other person not related to the association, at a private sale.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Unless otherwise agreed to or as stated in this section, the unit owner is liable for any deficiency in a foreclosure sale.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The proceeds of a foreclosure sale must be applied in the following order:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The reasonable expenses of sale;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The reasonable expenses of securing possession before sale; the reasonable expenses of holding, maintaining, and preparing the unit for sale, including payment of taxes and other governmental charges and premiums on insurance; and, to the extent provided for by agreement between the association and the unit owner, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and other legal expenses incurred by the association;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Satisfaction of the association's lien;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) Satisfaction in the order of priority of any subordinate claim of record; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(v) Remittance of any excess to the unit owner.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) A good-faith purchaser for value acquires the unit free of the association's debt that gave rise to the lien under which the foreclosure sale occurred and any subordinate interest, even though the association or other person conducting the sale failed to comply with this section. The person conducting the sale must execute a conveyance to the purchaser sufficient to convey the unit and stating that it is executed by the person after a foreclosure of the association's lien by power of sale and that the person was empowered to make the sale. Signature and title or authority of the person signing the conveyance as grantor and a recital of the facts of nonpayment of the assessment and of the giving of the notices required under this subsection are sufficient proof of the facts recited and of the authority to sign. Further proof of authority is not required even though the association is named as grantee in the conveyance.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) At any time before the association has conveyed a unit in a cooperative or entered into a contract for its conveyance under the power of sale, the unit owners or the holder of any subordinate security interest may cure the unit owner's default and prevent sale or other conveyance by tendering the performance due under the security agreement, including any amounts due because of exercise of a right to accelerate, plus the reasonable expenses of proceeding to foreclosure incurred to the time of tender, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the creditor.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(15) In an action by an association to collect assessments or to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section, the court may appoint a receiver to collect all sums alleged to be due and owing to a unit owner before commencement or during pendency of the action. The receivership is governed under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.60'>7.60</a> RCW. During pendency of the action, the court may order the receiver to pay sums held by the receiver to the association for any assessments against the unit. The exercise of rights under this subsection by the association does not affect the priority of preexisting liens on the unit.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(16) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the holder of a mortgage or other purchaser of a unit who obtains the right of possession of the unit through foreclosure is not liable for assessments or installments of assessments that became due prior to such right of possession. Such unpaid assessments are deemed to be common expenses collectible from all the unit owners, including such mortgagee or other purchaser of the unit. Foreclosure of a mortgage does not relieve the prior unit owner of personal liability for assessments accruing against the unit prior to the date of such sale as provided in this subsection.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(17) In addition to constituting a lien on the unit, each assessment is the joint and several obligation of the unit owner of the unit to which the same are assessed as of the time the assessment is due. A unit owner may not exempt himself or herself from liability for assessments. In a voluntary conveyance other than by foreclosure, the grantee of a unit is jointly and severally liable with the grantor for all unpaid assessments against the grantor up to the time of the grantor's conveyance, without prejudice to the grantee's right to recover from the grantor the amounts paid by the grantee. Suit to recover a personal judgment for any delinquent assessment is maintainable in any court of competent jurisdiction without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing such sums.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(18) The association may from time to time establish reasonable late charges and a rate of interest to be charged, not to exceed the maximum rate calculated under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.52.020'>19.52.020</a>, on all subsequent delinquent assessments or installments of assessments. If the association does not establish such a rate, delinquent assessments bear interest from the date of delinquency at the maximum rate calculated under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.52.020'>19.52.020</a> on the date on which the assessments became delinquent.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(19) The association is entitled to recover any costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the collection of delinquent assessments, whether or not such collection activities result in a suit being commenced or prosecuted to judgment. The prevailing party is also entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in such suits, including any appeals, if it prevails on appeal and in the enforcement of a judgment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(20) To the extent not inconsistent with this section, the declaration may provide for such additional remedies for collection of assessments as may be permitted by law.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(21) An association may not commence an action to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section unless:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The unit owner, at the time the action is commenced, owes at least a sum equal to the greater of:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Three months or more of assessments, not including fines, late charges, interest, attorneys' fees, or costs incurred by the association in connection with the collection of a delinquent owner's account; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) $200 of assessments, not including fines, late charges, interest, attorneys' fees, or costs incurred by the association in connection with the collection of a delinquent owner's account;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) At or after the date that assessments have become past due for at least 90 days, the association has mailed, by first-class mail, to the owner, at the unit address and to any other address which the owner has provided to the association, a notice of delinquency, which shall state as follows:</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">THIS IS A NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY FOR PAST DUE ASSESSMENTS</span></div><div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">FROM THE UNIT OWNERS' ASSOCIATION TO WHICH YOUR HOME BELONGS.</span></div><div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">THIS NOTICE IS ONE STEP IN A PROCESS THAT COULD RESULT IN YOUR LOSING YOUR HOME</span>.</div><div style="text-indent:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">CONTACT A HOUSING COUNSELOR OR AN ATTORNEY LICENSED IN WASHINGTON NOW</span> to assess your situation and refer you to mediation if you might benefit. <span style="font-weight:bold;">DO NOT DELAY</span>.</div><div style="text-indent:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">BE CAREFUL</span> of people who claim they can help you.
