The objective alternative assessments shall be comparable in rigor to the skills and knowledge that the student must demonstrate on the statewide student assessment and be objective in its determination of student achievement of the state standards. Before any objective alternative assessments in addition to those authorized in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.655.065'>28A.655.065</a> or (b) of this subsection are used by a student to demonstrate that the student has met the state standards in a content area required to obtain a certificate, the legislature shall formally approve the use of any objective alternative assessments through the omnibus appropriations act or by statute or concurrent resolution.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b)(i) A student's score on the mathematics, reading or English, or writing portion of the SAT or the ACT may be used as an objective alternative assessment under this section for demonstrating that a student has met or exceeded the state standards for the certificate of academic achievement. The state board of education shall identify the scores students must achieve on the relevant portion of the SAT or ACT to meet or exceed the state standard in the relevant content area on the statewide student assessment. A student's score on the science portion of the ACT or the science subject area tests of the SAT may be used as an objective alternative assessment under this section as soon as the state board of education determines that sufficient data is available to identify reliable equivalent scores for the science content area of the statewide student assessment. After the first scores are established, the state board may increase but not decrease the scores required for students to meet or exceed the state standards.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) A student who scores at least a three on the grading scale of one to five for selected AP examinations may use the score as an objective alternative assessment under this section for demonstrating that a student has met or exceeded state standards for the certificate of academic achievement. A score of three on the AP examinations in calculus or statistics may be used as an alternative assessment for the mathematics portion of the statewide student assessment. A score of three on the AP examinations in English language and composition may be used as an alternative assessment for the writing portion of the statewide student assessment; and for the English language arts portion of the assessment developed with the multistate consortium, once established in the 2014-15 school year. A score of three on the AP examinations in English literature and composition, macroeconomics, microeconomics, psychology, United States history, world history, United States government and politics, or comparative government and politics may be used as an alternative assessment for the reading portion of the statewide student assessment; and for the English language arts portion of the assessment developed with the multistate consortium, once established in the 2014-15 school year. A score of three on the AP examination in biology, physics, chemistry, or environmental science may be used as an alternative assessment for the science portion of the statewide student assessment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) A student who scores at least a four on selected externally administered international baccalaureate (IB) examinations may use the score as an objective alternative assessment under this section for demonstrating that the student has met or exceeded state standards for the certificate of academic achievement. A score of four on the higher level IB examinations for any of the IB English language and literature courses or for any of the IB individuals and societies courses may be used as an alternative assessment for the reading, writing, or English language arts portions of the statewide student assessment. A score of four on the higher level IB examinations for any of the IB mathematics courses may be used as an alternative assessment for the mathematics portion of the statewide student assessment. A score of four on the higher level IB examinations for IB biology, chemistry, or physics may be used as an alternative assessment for the science portion of the statewide student assessment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv)(A) In the 2018-19 school year, high school students who have not earned a certificate of academic achievement due to not meeting the high school graduation standard on the mathematics or English language arts assessment may take and pass a locally determined course in the content area in which the student was not successful, and may use the passing score on a locally administered assessment tied to that course and approved under the provisions of this subsection (9)(b)(iv), as an objective alternative assessment for demonstrating that the student has met or exceeded the high school graduation standard. High school transition courses and the assessments offered in association with high school transition courses shall be considered an approved locally determined course and assessment for demonstrating that the student met or exceeded the high school graduation standard. The course must be rigorous and consistent with the student's educational and career goals identified in his or her high school and beyond plan, and may include career and technical education equivalencies in English language arts or mathematics adopted pursuant to RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.230.097'>28A.230.097</a>. School districts shall record students' participation in locally determined courses under this section in the statewide individual data system.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(B) The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall develop a process by which local school districts can submit assessments for review and approval for use as objective alternative assessments for graduation as allowed by (b)(iv) of this subsection. This process shall establish means to determine whether a local school district-administered assessment is comparable in rigor to the skills and knowledge that the student must demonstrate on the statewide student assessment and is objective in its determination of student achievement of the state standards. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall post on its agency website a compiled list of local school district-administered assessments approved as objective alternative assessments, including the comparable scores on these assessments necessary to meet the standard.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(C) For the purpose of this section, "high school transition course" means an English language arts or mathematics course offered in high school where successful completion by a high school student ensures the student college-level placement at participating institutions of higher education as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.10.016'>28B.10.016</a>. High school transition courses must, in accordance with this section, satisfy core or elective credit graduation requirements established by the state board of education. A student's successful completion of a high school transition course does not entitle the student to be admitted to any institution of higher education as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.10.016'>28B.10.016</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(v) A student who completes a dual credit course in English language arts or mathematics in which the student earns college credit may use passage of the course as an objective alternative assessment under this section for demonstrating that the student has met or exceeded the high school graduation standard for the certificate of academic achievement.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(10) To help assure continued progress in academic achievement as a foundation for high school graduation and to assure that students are on track for high school graduation, each school district shall:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Provide students who have not earned a certificate of academic achievement before the beginning of grade eleven with the opportunity to access interventions and academic supports, courses, or both, designed to enable students to meet the high school graduation standard. These interventions, supports, or courses must be rigorous and consistent with the student's educational and career goals identified in his or her high school and beyond plan, and may include career and technical education equivalencies in English language arts or mathematics adopted pursuant to RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.230.097'>28A.230.097</a>; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Prepare student learning plans and notify students and their parents or legal guardians as provided in this subsection. Student learning plans are required for eighth grade students who were not successful on any or all of the content areas of the state assessment during the previous school year or who may not be on track to graduate due to credit deficiencies or absences. The parent or legal guardian shall be notified about the information in the student learning plan, preferably through a parent conference and at least annually. To the extent feasible, schools serving English language learner students and their parents shall translate the plan into the primary language of the family. The plan shall include the following information as applicable:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The student's results on the state assessment;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) If the student is in the transitional bilingual program, the score on his or her Washington language proficiency test II;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Any credit deficiencies;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) The student's attendance rates over the previous two years;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(v) The student's progress toward meeting state and local graduation requirements;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vi) The courses, competencies, and other steps needed to be taken by the student to meet state academic standards and stay on track for graduation;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vii) Remediation strategies and alternative education options available to students, including informing students of the option to continue to receive instructional services after grade twelve or until the age of twenty-one;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(viii) The alternative assessment options available to students under this section and RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.655.065'>28A.655.065</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ix) School district programs, high school courses, and career and technical education options available for students to meet graduation requirements; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(x) Available programs offered through skill centers or community and technical colleges, including the college high school diploma options under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.50.535'>28B.50.535</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(11) This section expires August 31, 2022.</div></div><div style="margin-top:15pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">[ <a href='http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session Laws/House/1599-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2019 c 252 § 105'>2019 c 252 § 105</a>;  <a href='http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session Laws/House/2224-S.SL.pdf?cite=2017 3rd sp.s. c 31 § 1'>2017 3rd sp.s. c 31 § 1</a>;  <a href='http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session Laws/House/2224-S.SL.pdf?cite=2017 3rd sp.s. c 31 § 5'>2017 3rd sp.s. c 31 § 5</a>;  <a href='http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session Laws/Senate/6145.SL.pdf?cite=2015 3rd sp.s. c 42 § 2'>2015 3rd sp.s. c 42 § 2</a>;  <a href='http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session Laws/House/1450.SL.pdf?cite=2013 2nd sp.s. c 22 § 2'>2013 2nd sp.s. c 22 § 2</a>;  <a href='http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session Laws/House/1410-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011 1st sp.s. c 22 § 2'>2011 1st sp.s. c 22 § 2</a>;  <a href='http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session Laws/Senate/6604-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010 c 244 § 1'>2010 c 244 § 1</a>;  <a href='http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session Laws/House/1758-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009 c 524 § 5'>2009 c 524 § 5</a>;  <a href='http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session Laws/Senate/6673-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2008 c 321 § 2'>2008 c 321 § 2</a>.

The state graduation requirements help to ensure that Washington high school graduates have the basic skills to be competitive in a global economy. Under education reform started in 1993, time was to be the variable, obtaining the skills was to be the constant. Therefore, students who need additional time to gain the academic skills needed for college and the workplace should have the opportunities they need to reach high academic achievement, even if that takes more than the standard four years of high school.</div><div style="text-indent:0.75in;">Different students face different challenges and barriers to their academic success. Some students struggle to meet the standard on a single portion of the Washington assessment of student learning while excelling in the other subject areas; other students struggle to complete the necessary state or local graduation credits; while still others have their knowledge tested on the assessments and have completed all the credit requirements but are struggling because English is not their first language. The legislature finds that many of these students need additional time and support to achieve academic proficiency and meet all graduation requirements."

The legislature finds that Washington schools and students are making significant progress in improving achievement in reading and writing.
