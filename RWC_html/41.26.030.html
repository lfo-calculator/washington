King County</span>, Cause No. 82842-3. The court recognized that a public employees' retirement system eligible employee must work for a public employees' retirement system employer under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=41.40.010'>41.40.010</a>. However, the court did not explain how such an employee can be an employee of a government contractor and also of a government employer. The legislature determines it necessary and appropriate to affirmatively state that a governmental contractor is not an employer for purposes of the state's public pension systems, including the public employees' retirement system, whether or not the contractor is providing mandatory or discretionary governmental services, and whether or not the contractor is a for-profit or not-for-profit entity.</div><div style="text-indent:0.75in;">(2) The legislature has not intended in its pension legislation to provide retirement system eligibility to employees of government contractors. Only in specific circumstances, such as employees of entities, including nonprofits, created by government under the interlocal cooperation act in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=39.34'>39.34</a> RCW, has the legislature and department of retirement systems permitted retirement system eligibility for employees of government contractors. The department's rules in WAC 415-02-110 conform to the purpose and intent of the legislature regarding public pension eligibility.</div><div style="text-indent:0.75in;">(3) It is the purpose of this act to more clearly state and to confirm that employees of for-profit or not-for-profit corporations or other entities providing services under governmental contracts are not, as a result of providing such governmental service, eligible for membership in the various public retirement programs. The state and its local governments have not provided for such eligibility and such eligibility would create unfunded liability for state and local governments and potential impacts on the integrity of the public pension systems.</div><div style="text-indent:0.75in;">(4) This act provides cross-references to existing statutes that affect eligibility for pensions under the retirement systems authorized by chapters  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=41.26'>41.26</a>, 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, 41.40, and  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=41.50'>41.50</a> RCW and to the relevant definition sections of those chapters. Except as provided, this act is technical in nature and neither enhances nor diminishes existing pension rights. It is not the intent of the legislature to change the substance or effect of any statute previously enacted. Rather, this act provides cross-references to applicable statutes in order to aid with the administration of eligibility and benefits authorized in chapters  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=41.26'>41.26</a>, 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, 41.40, and  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=41.50'>41.50</a> RCW.</div><div style="text-indent:0.75in;">(5) This act shall apply solely to eligibility for state-sponsored public employee pension plans under chapters  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=41.26'>41.26</a>, 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, and  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=41.40'>41.40</a> RCW and shall not affect any other statute or rule regarding employee benefits, status, or workplace protections.</div><div style="text-indent:0.75in;">(6) This act is curative and remedial, but does not affect the state supreme court decision in <span style="font-style:italic;">Dolan v.
